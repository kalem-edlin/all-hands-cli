- You must consider the SPEC doc as ideation from the user that communciates what they want to see in the feature / bug fix / implementation.
- It is a set of requirements grounded in the codebase and on user ideation reserach that express user expecations on how their idea will be reflected in the product's codebase.
- SPEC is NOT a set of hard requirements, but more a reflection on user intent / expecations / things theyve already pre approved when presented with codebase / reserach grounded constraints
- In order to preserve and always align with user intent / expecations, if your own in depth research of technologies or exploration of the codebase idetify constraints / limitations / alternatives that may be better than what the user expecation requirements reflect in SPEC, you MUST present these findings to the user so they can align their expecations, agree with one / multiple of your alternatives OR fight for their original expecations.
