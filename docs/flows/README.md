# Flows

Workflow definitions that guide agents through tasks. Flows follow a lifecycle from ideation through execution to knowledge compounding.

## Lifecycle Flows

| Phase | Flow | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| Foundation | Core harness integration | `docs/flows/core-harness-integration.md` |
| Ideation | Spec planning (ideation + planning) | `docs/flows/spec-planning.md` |
| Pre-execution | Plan review jury | `docs/flows/plan-review-jury.md` |
| Research | Plan deepening and research | `docs/flows/plan-deepening-and-research.md` |
| Execution | Prompt task execution | `docs/flows/prompt-task-execution.md` |
| Refinement | Emergent refinement | `docs/flows/emergent-refinement.md` |
| Post-execution | Judge reviewing | `docs/flows/judge-reviewing.md` |
| Feedback | PR reviewing | `docs/flows/pr-reviewing.md` |
| Coordination | Coordination services | `docs/flows/coordination.md` |
| Knowledge | Compounding | `docs/flows/compounding.md` |
